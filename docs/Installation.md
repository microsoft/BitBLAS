# Installation Guide



## Installing with pip

**Prerequisites for installation via wheel or PyPI:**
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 or later
- **Python Version**: >= 3.8
- **CUDA Version**: >= 11.0

The easiest way to install BitBLAS is direcly from the PyPi using pip. To install the latest version, run the following command in your terminal.

**Note**: Currently, BitBLAS whl is only supported on Ubuntu 20.04 or later version as we build the whl files on this platform. Currently we only provide whl files for CUDA>=11.0 and with Python>=3.8. **If you are using a different platform or environment, you may need to [build BitBLAS from source](https://github.com/microsoft/BitBLAS/blob/main/docs/Installation.md#building-from-source).**

```bash
pip install bitblas
```

Alternatively, you may choose to install BitBLAS using prebuilt packages available on the Release Page:

```bash
pip install bitblas-0.0.0.dev0+ubuntu.20.4.cu120-py3-none-any.whl
```

After installing BitBLAS, you can verify the installation by running:

```bash
python -c "import bitblas; print(bitblas.__version__)"  
```

## Building from Source

**Prerequisites for building from source:**
- **Operating System**: Linux
- **Python Version**: >= 3.7
- **CUDA Version**: >= 10.0

We recommend using a docker container with the necessary dependencies to build BitBLAS from source. You can use the following command to run a docker container with the necessary dependencies:

```bash
docker run --gpus all -it --rm --ipc=host nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:23.01-py3
```

To build and install BitBLAS directly from source, follow the steps below. This process requires certain pre-requisites from apache tvm, which can be installed on Ubuntu/Debian-based systems using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-dev python3-setuptools gcc libtinfo-dev zlib1g-dev build-essential cmake libedit-dev libxml2-dev
```

After installing the prerequisites, you can clone the BitBLAS repository and install it using pip:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Microsoft/BitBLAS.git
cd BitBLAS
pip install .  # Please be patient, this may take some time.
```

if you want to install BitBLAS with the development mode, you can run the following command:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
